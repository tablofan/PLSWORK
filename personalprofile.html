    <h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>

    Result: INTP-A, Logician
<br>
<br>
After reading the explanations for the result, I think the result describes me reasonably accurately. Some of the positives listed for being a logician include being open-minded and analytical in my way of thinking (Strengths & Weaknesses | Logician (INTP) Personality | 16Personalities, 2020). Negatives include being introverted and insensitive, and often second guessing myself due to being so open to new ideas. The results of this test has made me realise that I should be more outgoing, or extraverted, as that would allow for more fluent communication when working in a team environment. When forming a team, I should consider teaming up with extraverts, as they are more likely to communicate their ideas and give updates on their progress.

I don’t think these results are very accurate. Some of the traits listed for an auditory learner include reading stories/directions out loud, preference for having questions read out loud, recording myself spelling words and listening to the recordings, and studying by reading out loud (Self-Assessments, 2020). I would personally say that I’m more of a visual person, as I don’t ever do any of the things listed. I don’t see the results of this test impacting my ability to perform in a team at all. I feel like this test is not as important as the personality test when it comes to forming a team, as this test reflects on your personal ability to learn.

   The Big Five Personality Test is a widely accepted personality test in the scientific community. It differs from the Myer-Briggs model by providing a trait model of personality, rather than a type model. The results of the test are given in a spectrum along the five traits, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. My results say that I am not very open-minded, meaning I am not very creative and tend to stick with more practical and concrete ideas (The Big Five Personality Test, 2020). 

My conscientiousness rating of 37.5% means that I am rarely goal orientated, and often act on impulse. My low extraversion rating represents how I rarely seek attention, and prefer to stick to myself. Agreeableness represents how often I am to prioritize the need of others over my own, and my rating of 42% means that I often think of myself first, before realising the need of others (The Big Five Personality Test, 2020). Neuroticism is the rating of a person’s tendency to respond to stress with negative emotions. My neuroticism rating is exactly neutral, meaning I can deal with stressful situations decently well. I think these results represent me relatively well, and are in line with the results from the Myers-Briggs test. This test has made me realise that I am rather selfish, and should prioritize others more when working in a team environment. The results from this test also solidifies my need to be more outgoing as that could make communication more fluent with team members. When forming a team, I would prefer to have someone in the team that is high in openness, as that would mean they are very creative in their way of thinking, and would compliment my style well.
