    This job is an AWS cloud security architect requiring a wide variety of skills and experience. From the description it looks like the company is a financial services company, possibly a bank, utilizing a hybrid infrastructure, as seen from the line “50% working with cloud security and 50% with on-prem”. The job involves designing and implementing secure cloud and on-prem architecture, and reviewing current security protocols that are already in place. I am very interested in this job as it allows me to combine what I’ve learnt from completing AWS certifications with skills that I will learn from this degree.
<br>
<br>
The job requires you to have experience working with various security tools, both on-premises (Checkpoint, Palo Alto) and on the Amazon Web Services infrastructure (IAM, CloudTrail). The job also requires 5 years of experience in security engineering along with experience working with DevOps tools, such as Ansible, Puppet, and Python.
<br>
<br>
The skills I currently possess are experience working within the AWS infrastructure, being very familiar with the AWS security tools, and some basic experience working with Puppet and Python. However, I lack experience working in a related field and lack knowledge about on-prem security tools.
<br>
<br>
I plan to obtain the experience needed by finding an entry-level cyber security job after/during completing my Bachelor of IT. I also plan to complete all AWS certifications in the future (5 left out of 12) as well as common security related certifications, such as CompTIA Security+. These certificates would provide me with the knowledge needed to start working with security tools such as Checkpoint or Palo Alto.
